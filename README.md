# Mini Side Project of a Game, Inspiration from Tron & Snake
 - Defeat your opponent by forcing the opponent to crash into you or the wall.
 - Acquire power-ups to help you in this goal!
 - This game works best as 2-player mode then vs CPU.
 - Gameplay is fully functional
-  Most items are implemented
-  Rough AI that may be unforgivable or dies without question at times (Can Revise this AI to be better)
-  No menus to select two-player (have to force this in code)
